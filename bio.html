        <h2>A little info about <em>me!</em></h2>
     <p>These are my <em>interests!</em></p>
       <p>I enjoy being in the outdoors, spending time with my Alaskan Malamute/Pit Bull puppy, and working at <em> <a href="http://www.elevate.blue/"target"_blank">Elevate Blue</a></em>, a new tech accelerator located in Incline Village!</p>
     <p>
       I graduated from <em> <a href= "http://www.sierranevada.edu/" target"_blank">Sierra Nevada College</a></em> in December 2015 and will be walking in <strong>May 2016!</strong>
       
       <p> One of my favorite trips from the past year was my month long canyoneering course in the canyons of Utah. I was able to take this course through the <strong> <a href="http://www.sierranevada.edu/academics/interdisciplinary-studies/outdoor-adventure-leadership/"target"_blank"> ODAL program</a></strong> at SNC, and the course was facilitated through <a href="https://www.nols.edu/"target"_blank">NOLS</a>.
